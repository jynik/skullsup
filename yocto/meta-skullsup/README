This README file contains information on the contents of the
meta-skullsup layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.


Dependencies
============

This layer depends on:

  URI: git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky.git
  layers: meta, meta-poky, meta-yocto-bsp
  branch: rocko

This layer has been tested using a Raspberry Pi, which has
the following dependencies:

  URI: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
  layers: meta-oe, meta-multimedia, meta-networking, meta-python
  branch: rocko

I. Adding the meta-skullsup layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-skullsup layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-skullsup layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/skullsup/yocto/meta-skullsup \
    "


II. Building the skullsup-queue-reader-image
=================================================

Before you can build the skullsup-queue-reader-image, you must add
a few items in your local.conf. These items will be used to fill in
configuration file entries.

SKULLSUP_DEVICE         Serial port the Skulls Up! device is connected to.
                        Defaults to /dev/serial0.

SKULLSUP_REMOTE_HOST    The hostname or IP address of the skullsup-queue-server.
                        This is required.

SKULLSUP_REMOTE_PORT    The port the skullsup-queue-server is listening on.
                        Defaults to 16661 if not specified.

SKULLSUP_POLL_PERIOD    The number of seconds between dequeue attempts.
                        Defaults to 10 if not specified.

SKULLSUP_DIR            Base directory for skullsup configuration and log files.
                        Use /opt/skullsup unless you have another preference.

SKULLSUP_QUEUE_READER_CONFIG    The full path to the skullsup-queue-reader
                                configuration file that you want installed
                                in the image. This is required.

The following items are optional and will fall back to default values if
not specified. However, these defaults may not neccess


The default /etc/network/interfaces ships with both wlan0 and eth0 configured
automatically with DHCP. The following are optional if you use eth0 or make
some other modifications such that you don't require WiFi.

**IMPORTANT**: Be aware that storing your SSID and PSK in the image implies
that anyone with access to your Yocto build environment, build artifacts
(i.e. image file)or your platform could connect to your network!

SKULLSUP_WIFI_SSID      SSID of the WiFi network that shall be used.
SKULLSUP_WPA_PSK        The WiFi WPA2 PSK that should be used. This should be
                        the in hexadecimal format, as display by the output of
                        the wpa_passphrase program.


After filling the above items in, you should be able to run the following
to create an image that you can boot on your platform.

    bitbake skullsup-queue-reader-image

This image is core-image-minimal with some additional scripts and software to
launch the a skullsup-queue-reader at boot. Be sure to remove `debug-tweaks`
from your EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES to remove passwordless root logins!
